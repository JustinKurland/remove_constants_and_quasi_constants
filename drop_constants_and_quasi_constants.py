    Constant and quasi-constant function that searches the 
    feature space and removes all features that are either constant
    or quasi-constant based upon the user-specified threshold.

    Args:
        df ([Pandas Dataframe]): 
            A Pandas Dataframe that has the totality of the 
            features that are in contention to be leveraged
            for actual models.
        threshold ([int]) optional): 
            Sets the variance threshold for features to select. 
            Defaults to 0.99.

    Returns:
        [Pandas Dataframe]: 
            A Pandas Dataframe that has removed all the constants
            and quasi-constants from the feature space.
