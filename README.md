# remove_constants_and_quasi_constants

Function that removes constants and quasi-constant features from a feature set. The function simply drops all those features that are either constants or quasi-constants based upon a user-defined threshold related to the degree of constancy. 

Can be method chained if used with ```Pandas-Flavor``` making it more flexible for the development of a cleaning operation prior to modelling efforts.
